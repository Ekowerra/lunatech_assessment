This project is an assessment due to Lunatech.
Use environment variable to connect a postgresql database : {POSTGRESQL_URI, POSTGRESQL_USER, POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD}
The csv files must be inserted inside the base before starting the project.

Only the back-end has been implemented for now. The front-end comes soon.
