This project is an assessment due to Lunatech.
Use environment variable to connect a postgresql database : {POSTGRESQL_URI, POSTGRESQL_USER, POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD}

The tables must be created before running the project using the script 1.sql (evolution is not enabled).
The csv files must be inserted inside the base before running the project.

Only the back-end has been implemented for now. The front-end comes soon.
